# Description

This module exploits a MOV SS vulnerability that is specifically made against Microsoft Windows
(excpet for Windows XP). It will upload a pre-compiled exploit onto the target machine, followed
by the final payload (such as a Meterpreter) in order to gain remote code execution.

# Vulnerable Target

Please note that this module may not work with certain hypervisors (such as VMWare). You should
test it on a real machine if possible.
