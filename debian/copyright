 .
 Preamble
 .
 This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
 Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
 The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
 control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
 Package available as open source and free software.
 .
 You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
 license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
 terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
 make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
 a different licensing arrangement.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
 named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
 .
 "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
 material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
 procedures.
 .
 "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
 distribute, or modify the Package.
 .
 "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
 Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
 those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
 Version, or a Modified Version.
 .
 "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
 accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
 organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
 .
 "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
 this Package or providing support for this Package to another
 party. It does not mean licensing fees.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
 modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
 by the Copyright Holder.
 .
 "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
 such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
 Holder.
 .
 "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
 the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
 it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
 .
 "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
 configuration files for the Package.
 .
 "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
 or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
 translation of the Source form.
 .
 Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
 .
 (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
 Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
 you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
 .
 .
 Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
 .
 (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
 either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
 all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At
 your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
 Compiled form of the Package.
 .
 (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
 modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
 Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
 will be subject to the Original License.
 .
 .
 Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 .
 (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
 or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
 Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
 from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
 any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
 you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
 of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
 Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
 Version.
 .
 (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
 prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
 addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
 from the name of the Standard Version.
 .
 (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
 make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
 under
 .
 (i) the Original License or

 (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
 modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
 licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
 received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
 Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
 available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
 Fees are allowed.
 .
 .
 Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
 or Modified Versions without the Source
 .
 (5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
 the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
 get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be
 valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any
 time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
 must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
 If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
 days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
 you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 .
 (6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
 the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
 the Source of the Modified Version.
 .
 .
 Aggregating or Linking the Package
 .
 (7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
 Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
 aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
 Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
 components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
 apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
 as included in the aggregation.
 .
 (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
 other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
 build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
 include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
 provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
 .
 .
 Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 .
 (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
 merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
 the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not
 considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
 terms of this license.
 .
 .
 General Provisions
 .
 (10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
 Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
 modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
 use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
 license.
 .
 (11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
 Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
 to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
 this license.
 .
 (12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
 service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
 .
 (13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
 free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
 sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
 patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
 infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
 that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
 infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
 date that such litigation is filed.
 .

 (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the
 notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your
 Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and
 .
 (c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make
 Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either
 available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your
 Modifications, or publicly available. Source Code of Your Externally
 Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in
 this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3
 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve
 (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is
 longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your
 Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a
 web site).
 .
 2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You
 Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in
 object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent
 notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation,
 stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the
 terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such
 Source Code.
 .
 2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that
 although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their
 respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no
 assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered
 Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
 rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any
 liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
 infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
 condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You
 hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
 property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
 license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is
 Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
 Covered Code.
 .
 3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the
 licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any
 person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this
 License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license,
 under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property
 rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use,
 reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and
 Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as
 Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.
 .
 4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
 Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
 distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance,
 You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
 the Covered Code or any portion thereof.
 .
 5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in
 Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by
 Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional
 patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole
 discretion.
 .
 6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other
 rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein
 ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
 However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole
 responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You
 must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms
 are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend
 and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability
 incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by
 reason of any such Additional Terms.
 .
 7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new
 versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given
 a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published
 under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it
 under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
 Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this
 License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to
 modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
 License.
 .
 8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in
 part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered
 Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and
 may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge
 and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at
 Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
 WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND
 APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE
 PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
 ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF
 MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
 PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST
 INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE
 FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,
 THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
 ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO
 ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE
 AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.
 You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the
 operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication
 systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of
 the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe
 physical or environmental damage.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
 EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
 SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
 TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR
 ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY,
 TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF
 APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
 REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF
 INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
 TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all
 damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this
 License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).
 .
 10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the
 trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac", "Mac OS",
 "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other trademarks,
 service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively
 "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name
 belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple Marks in
 or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or
 to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other
 than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times
 with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted
 at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.
 .
 11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License,
 each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
 Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights,
 title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications
 made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple
 Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple
 may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple
 Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those
 contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.
 .
 12. Termination.
 .
 12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
 terminate:
 .
 (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with
 any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30
 days of becoming aware of such breach;
 .
 (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
 13.5(b); or
 .
 (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during
 the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
 against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence
 an action for patent infringement against You in that instance.
 .
 12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately
 stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and
 distribution of the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code
 which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive
 any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature,
 should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
 survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11,
 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation,
 indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating
 this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this
 License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of
 any party.
 .
 13. Miscellaneous.
 .
 13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as
 defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in
 the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the
 public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license
 in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR
 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for
 Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data --
 Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer
 Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S.
 Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set
 forth herein.
 .
 13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as
 creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of
 legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and
 You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by
 implication, appearance or otherwise.
 .
 13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair
 Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for
 it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the
 same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,
 Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may
 develop, produce, market or distribute.
 .
 13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to
 enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of
 future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or
 regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
 construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.
 .
 13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent
 jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,
 to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to
 the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits
 and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will
 continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or
 specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the
 enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will
 immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of
 the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your
 possession or control.
 .
 13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution
 between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the
 Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to
 the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal
 courts within that District with respect to this License. The
 application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
 International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
 .
 13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the
 entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
 matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the
 United States and the State of California, except that body of
 California law concerning conflicts of law.
